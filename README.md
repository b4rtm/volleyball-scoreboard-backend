# Voleyball scoreboard

It is an interactive volleyball scoreboard web app that enables real-time match
management. Provided a user-friendly interface for match and team creation, along
with detailed match history. Implemented a user authentication system with referee
and observer roles, ensuring data integrity and access control. I used WebSockets for
bidirectional communication, enabling instant updates of match status for all users.

This application is hosted on Render and the database is hosted on Neon.
